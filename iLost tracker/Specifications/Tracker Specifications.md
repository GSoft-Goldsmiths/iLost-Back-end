The ilost tracker consists of 4 major parts; Raspberry Pi zero, Li-Poly battery, Hologram Nova cellular modem, physical case.

## Raspberry pi zero (no Wi-Fi version)

**OPERATING TEMPERATURE**

The Raspberry Pi is built from commercial chips which are qualified to different temperature ranges; the LAN9514 (LAN9512 on older models with 2 USB ports) is specified by the manufacturers as being qualified from 0°C to 70°C, while the SoCis qualified from -40°C to 85°C. You may well find that the board will work outside those temperatures, but we’re not qualifying the board itself to these extremes.
